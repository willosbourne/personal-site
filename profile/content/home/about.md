# Biography

Will Osbourne is a web developer who is bad at writing descriptions. If you're reading this, you came to the page a bit early. Welcome!

This site, while technically deployed still contains a lot of example framework. Not everything on this page is representative of me, and therefore should not be taken as fact.
