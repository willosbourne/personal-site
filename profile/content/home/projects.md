Outside of work, I have several on-going projects / pass-times that I work on. 
I try to keep a nice variety of pass-times to stay mentally active and engaged, while avoiding fatigue and burnout.

## 1. Personal Sites
I have been working with static site generators and other JAMstack utilities in my spare time recently. For starters, this site is built with Hugo and hosted with Netlify.
I also have other sites using Gatsby as a tool to help me learn React.

Recently, I stood up a Node API for personal use with Heroku and have been experimenting with creating my own API to server as a hub for interacting with anything from weather stations to smart devices.

## 2. Music Production
I won't be quitting my day job any time soon, but I think it's vital for those with analytical focused careers, such as software development, to have a creative outlet.
To broaden my horizons past something like web design, I took up making music as a pass-time.
This has proven to be a great mood enhancer, and a good way to keep my mind engaged while giving it a rest from meticulous development.

## 3. Writing Blog Posts
Another recent endevour of mine has been writing technology blog posts.
Currently, I haven't published anything yet, as I'd like to build a backlog and gain some more practice.
However, I already can feel the benefits of finding something I feel confidently knowledgable in and digging deeper and deeper in an attempt to become an expert.

_By the way_ this is how you put images in a markdown page, because I know you're gonna wanna know, and I know you're not gonna remember.
