## Seven Hills Technology

My current job is at [Seven Hills Technology](https://sevenhillstechnology.com/) since May of 2017, after my first two semesters at the University of Cincinnati. At this job, I'm a junior software / web developer. Throughout my academic terms, I continue to work part time, both operating remotely and going into the office on occasion.

Working at Seven Hills gave me the opportunity to work both as a team member for a contracted business, and on internal projects. Working with clients where the software and web applications are not the sole purpose helps me learn how to prioritize business needs into the end product. On the flip side, these internal projects are run by Seven Hills or business partners such as [Reperio](https://reper.io/) have shown how working in a highly developer focused environment can be incredibly productive while still yielding in a fantastic end product.

### Technologies Learned

As a consulting and contracting company, my time at Seven Hills has been full of different technology stacks that have given me a broad view of web development that continues to grow to this day. I have worked on .NET and .NET Core supporting aging applications, used AngularJS with a Node.js backend for clients main internal sites, and have worked with React with Typescript on newer projects.

Some of the more interesting projects that I was able to work on, or take a leading role in have been the development of an intercompany API to move a client away from a file based data transfer system, as well as exploring efficient means of handling an influx of data that requires intense sorting and processing in a way that doesn't impact the business from continuing normal operations.

## Session Breakdown

### Spring 2018

In the start of my time working with Seven Hills, I was writing code from day one. I started working on a customer facing .NET application. This was a great introduction to large scale web development for me, as I got clear instruction performing small updates and bug fixes. This session also introduced me to proper git practices and working in a scrum / kanban environment.

### Fall 2018

After gaining experience, I started to split my work mainly between incrementally overhauling the UI of the .NET site I worked on previously, and learning more JavaScript on an AngularJS / NodeJS site for the same company. This gave me the opportunity to experience working on different applications in the same company, and understand how the data interacted between them. During this time, I also began working for a few days a week on-site with the client company, which helped me learn how to work in different environments, and be a representative for my company.
