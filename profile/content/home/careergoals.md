My career goals can be boiled down to two basic points. I want to do *full stack development*, and I want *work-life balance*. First, while I can enjoy being on one side or the other of building a web app, I always feel best when I have my hands in the whole stack. This means it's my goal to continue to learn and grow in ever aspect of web apps, from hosting them efficiently to designing them beautifully. Second, while I love web development, there's so much else that I enjoy too, which is why finding a company that I enjoy working at, but will also respect my personal time is a top level priority for me.
